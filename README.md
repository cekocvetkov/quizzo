# Quizzo
An application for performing CRUD operations on quizzes.

The main idea of this project was to play around with server side rendering and Next.js server actions

## Data layer
Quizzos are saved in a SQLite database in order to simplify the data layer (Prisma is used as ORM). The focus on this project is mainly the Next.js Data Fetching and not the underlying persistence itself.

### Prisma studio GUI
npx prisma studio

### Initializing the database (if needs to reset, delete igrations folder etc.)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

### Seeding the database (defined in package.json)
npx prisma db seed 

## Next.js Generated Documentation:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
