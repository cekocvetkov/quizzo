### Server Actions 
These are an alpha feature in Next.js, built on top of React Actions. They enable server-side data mutations, reduced client-side JavaScript, and progressively enhanced forms. They can be defined inside Server Components and/or called from Client Components

In this 'Delete' *client* component we can call the delete method from the server. This is a very cool Next.js 13 feature.
